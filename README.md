# Trying to reproduce gpt
My own project trying to reproduce a gpt model. I trained it both on the tiny shakespeare dataset and on the dailymails dataset found on the internet.

Here there is some output of the model on tiny shakespeare:

_CORIOLANUS:

most she the shame; here's it have paid too. He give
a it poison, by the trull; I do none worse it
notious noty, done to half dissolUes, hath
varvetulla bean you ever by an a man's loss a
as burnm, that use if my remlioned see so.

LATTINGE:
Brach, windneed, though know you.

Girl:

villanous intendedss in's grave your wrongs she._
