# Reproducing a GPT Model

This repository contains my personal project aimed at reproducing a GPT model. The model has been trained on two different datasets: the **tiny Shakespeare dataset** and the **DailyMail dataset** found online.

## Sample Output from the Tiny Shakespeare Dataset

Below is an example of the model's output when trained on the tiny Shakespeare dataset:

*CORIOLANUS:  
If should desire: see he here thoughts, as let  
most she the shame; here's it have paid too. He give  
a it poison, by the trull; I do none worse it  
notious noty, done to half dissolves, hath  
varvetulla bean you ever by an a man's loss a  
as burnm, that use if my remlioned see so.*

*LATTINGE:  
Brach, windneed, though know you.*

## Sample output from the dailymails dataset:

* The U.S. Embassy in Washington, Virginia, said it would be a "great relief" for the government to take the country. "We are not going to make sure that we have a lot of time to do," said Rep. Michael D.C. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report.<|endoftext>|Two people have been arrested in the country's capital city of Raqqa, a city in the city of Raqqa, Syria, in the area. The suspected gunman, who was arrested on suspicion of being in the country, is charged with first-degree murder, aggravated murder and aggravated kidnapping. The suspect, who was caught in a car in the city's capital, is charged with first-degree murder and aggravated murder by the force. Scroll down for video *
