# Reproducing a GPT Model

This repository contains my personal project aimed at reproducing a GPT model. The model has been trained on two different datasets: the **tiny Shakespeare dataset** and the **DailyMail dataset** found online.

## Sample Output from the Tiny Shakespeare Dataset

Below is an example of the model's output when trained on the tiny Shakespeare dataset:

*CORIOLANUS:  
If should desire: see he here thoughts, as let  
most she the shame; here's it have paid too. He give  
a it poison, by the trull; I do none worse it  
notious noty, done to half dissolUes, hath  
varvetulla bean you ever by an a man's loss a  
as burnm, that use if my remlioned see so.*

*LATTINGE:  
Brach, windneed, though know you.*

*Girl:  
Such fault lose here be all: he gone, Saint Gmustirty, Aumeum,  
villanous intendedss in's grave your wrongs she.*
