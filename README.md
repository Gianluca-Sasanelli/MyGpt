# Reproducing a GPT Model

This repository contains my personal project aimed at reproducing a GPT model. The model has been trained on two different datasets: the **tiny Shakespeare dataset** and the **DailyMail dataset** found online.

## Sample Output from the Tiny Shakespeare Dataset

Below is an example of the model's output when trained on the tiny Shakespeare dataset:

*CORIOLANUS:  
If should desire: see he here thoughts, as let  
most she the shame; here's it have paid too. He give  
a it poison, by the trull; I do none worse it  
notious noty, done to half dissolves, hath  
varvetulla bean you ever by an a man's loss a  
as burnm, that use if my remlioned see so.*

*LATTINGE:  
Brach, windneed, though know you.*

*Girl:  
Such fault lose here be all: he gone, Saint Gmustirty, Aumeum,  
villanous intendedss in's grave your wrongs she.*

## Sample output from the dailymails dataset:

*Gearing at the top of 5 and 28,500 to 12.59-old Lyle used an English passion that he was a good student at 11,000lbs, to which a huge increase at approximately $10,000. He has achieved enough in his second year of boxing after a stint in July, this year. But it is hoped that the 5.54 metres has grown dramatically in recent events which have sunk about 18,420. 'I'm lucky,' he told ABC4-Ranger. 'And I'm fortunate with it wasn't like anything else but I wanted to ever even hang around to them, just to get lucky. 'I'm lucky to be OK, but that didn't happen to me because I didn't want to fly around, but by accident on her second season was just an unfortunate decision, the job itself was to pay high the $40,000 of the $10,000 bonus has gotten the $40 million goal here so to get her money back. Now, the $41 million dollar for the company. It's just like she wants to buy the $26,000 a year worth $5,000. Scroll down for video . Gearing on the popular television as he was at a basketball game, Gearing on the A5-D smash set of track, Gearing on the A5 . Gearing on the track, Gearing on his phone said Gearing on the channel: 'It was my chance to throw the game unfold as Mr Gearing on the watchâ€”and a lot of things that seemed a little bit too scary.'*
